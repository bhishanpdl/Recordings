# Create gif files
- Record screen area using [Capto](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/capto-screen-capture-record/id1078184147?mt=12).
- Go to menubar, click save, rename file, then change type from mov to mp4.
- Convert mp4 to gif using [Gifski](https://gif.ski/).

# Notes
- To scroll the webpage in Google Chrome, we can use addons [Simple Auto Scroll](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-auto-scroll/dccjkemhmffnljlnnoffljpkhkfpldff?hl=en) and [Scroll to Top](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scroll-to-top/hegiignepmecppikdlbohnnbfjdoaghj?hl=en-US).
- Once we record screen, we can edit the recorded video in Capto,
but we can not upload video to Capto and edit it there.
- Also we can select the portion of video to convert to gif in Gifski.
